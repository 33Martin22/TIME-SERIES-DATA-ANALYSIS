Time Series - Forecast on global temperatures Business Problem: Anticipation and Mitigation of Economic and Environmental Impacts Caused by Global Warming

Objective: Use historical global temperature data to build a long-term temperature trend forecasting model, analyzing the impact on specific sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and infrastructure. The aim is to provide insights that can guide mitigation and adaptation strategies, helping governments and companies prepare for the future impacts of climate change in different regions and industries.

Components for Analysis:

1.Time Trend Analysis: Analyze trends in average, minimum, and maximum temperatures over the years by region (country, state, city). Assess seasonal variations and anomalies that may suggest accelerated climate change in certain areas.

2.Temperature Forecasting with Time Series Models: Develop a temperature forecasting model for the next 10, 20, and 50 years, highlighting regions with the highest warming trends. Methods like ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM neural networks could be used to predict future changes in global and regional temperatures.

3.Risk and Opportunity Mapping: Based on temperature forecasts, identify vulnerable regions to environmental impacts (e.g., sea level rise in coastal areas) and economic sectors that are most exposed (such as agriculture, which depends on climate).

4.Cost Estimation and Infrastructure Planning: Assess expected economic impacts, such as increased energy costs due to cooling demand and potential agricultural losses.
